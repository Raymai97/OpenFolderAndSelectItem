# About the code

In order to minimize effort, code and executable size, please take note that:
1) The code is NOT using best practice.
2) There is no error checking.
3) Process exit code is always zero.
4) Standard C functions are avoided at all cost.
5) If you pass invalid file path to it, nothing will happen.

If you do not agree with the design, please kindly fork the repo and do what you like.

If you found a bug, as in:
1) You passed correct file path, and "explorer.exe" is running, but nothing happen.
2) You passed invalid file path, but it shows error, or it crashed, or causing other process to crash.

Please do report the bug.
